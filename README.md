# **CRANE** (***CR***aniometric ***AN***cestry ***E***stimator) 
> A Deep Learning-Powered Estimator for Population Ancestry Affiliation based on Craniometric Features
## Introduction
Welcome to **CRANE** (CRaniometric ANcestry Estimator), a deep learning model to provide fine-grained estimations of ancestry using craniometric data. 
The goal of CRANE is to enhance accuracy (with an average predictive accuracy of 94%) and utility of craniometric ancestry estimation. 
By providing more precise and reliable information, CRANE seeks to be an invaluable asset in forensic practice, 
as well as other anthropological research. 
The model was trained using Howells' craniometric data and aims to estimate a user-provided cranium's affinity 
to each of the 26 worldwide ancestry populations (see a ***Summary of the Populations*** below). 

Designed as a user-friendly platform for researchers and forensic anthropologists, CRANE offers several key advantages: 
it provides probabilistic estimates of affinities for each ancestry population, capably handles incomplete craniometric 
data (missing measurements), and includes an estimation of the reliability or uncertainty associated with each prediction.
